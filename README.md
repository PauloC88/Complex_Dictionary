# Complex_Dictionary
### WellCode - My fourth project
I created a Romanian - English dictionary. There are four buttons on the page: 
- the first one adds to the list a Romanian word and its English translation from its above Input Text elements, but only if the Romanian word doesn't already exist in the list (otherwise it displays a message on the same page); 
- the second button simply checks if the Romanian word from its above Searchbox element already exists or not in the list, displays a message on the same page and it also redisplays the whole list; 
- the third button searches the list for the Romanian word from its above Searchbox element and displays on the same page only the word and its English translation or a message (in case the Romanian word doesn't exist in the list); 
- the fourth button simply redisplays the whole list.
